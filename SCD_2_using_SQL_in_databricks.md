Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2 in Databricks using SQL involves creating a mechanism to track historical changes in a dimension table. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Tables

Assuming you have a source table (`source_table`) and a target dimension table (`dim_table`), ensure the target table has the following structure:

- **Business Key**: Unique identifier for the entity (e.g., `customer_id`).
- **Attributes**: The attributes you want to track (e.g., `customer_name`, `address`, etc.).
- **Effective Date**: The date when the record became effective (e.g., `effective_date`).
- **End Date**: The date when the record was no longer effective (e.g., `end_date`).
- **Current Flag**: A flag to indicate if the record is the current version (e.g., `is_current`).

### Step 2: Create the Dimension Table

Create the dimension table if it doesn’t exist:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dim_table (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name STRING,
    address STRING,
    effective_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    is_current BOOLEAN
);
```

### Step 3: Identify Changes in the Source Data

Use a SQL query to find records that need to be updated or inserted into the dimension table. This typically involves checking for changes against the existing records.

```sql
WITH changes AS (
    SELECT 
        s.customer_id,
        s.customer_name,
        s.address,
        CURRENT_DATE() AS effective_date
    FROM 
        source_table s
    LEFT JOIN 
        dim_table d ON s.customer_id = d.customer_id AND d.is_current = TRUE
    WHERE 
        d.customer_id IS NULL OR
        (s.customer_name <> d.customer_name OR s.address <> d.address)
)
```

### Step 4: Update the Existing Records

For existing records that are changing, set their `end_date` and `is_current` flag:

```sql
UPDATE dim_table
SET end_date = CURRENT_DATE(),
    is_current = FALSE
WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM changes);
```

### Step 5: Insert New or Updated Records

Insert new records from the changes identified earlier:

```sql
INSERT INTO dim_table (customer_id, customer_name, address, effective_date, end_date, is_current)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    customer_name, 
    address, 
    effective_date, 
    NULL AS end_date, 
    TRUE AS is_current
FROM changes;
```

### Step 6: Review Your Data

After running the above steps, you can query the dimension table to see the current and historical records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dim_table ORDER BY customer_id, effective_date;
```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can implement SCD Type 2 in Databricks using SQL. This process allows you to maintain historical data while tracking changes in dimension attributes effectively. Be sure to adjust the column names and data types to fit your specific use case.
