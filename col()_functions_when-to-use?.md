#### QUE : from pyspark.sql.functions import split

data = \[("harppy/harsh",),]
schema = \["names"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data,schema)
df = df.select("names",
split("names","/")\[0].alias("name1"),
split("names","/")\[1].alias("name2")
)
df.show()

This code is working fine. so in which scenario we need to use col() function ?

#### ANS :

Excellent question! You're right — your current code works without explicitly using `col()`, and that’s totally valid in many cases. However, there **are scenarios where `col()` becomes necessary or more readable**.

---

### ✅ When `col()` is **not required**:

Inside transformations like `select()`, `withColumn()`, or `filter()`, PySpark is smart enough to interpret a string (like `"names"`) as a column reference:

```python
split("names", "/")[0].alias("name1")  # Works fine
```

---

### ✅ When `col()` **is needed or preferred**:

#### 1. **When chaining operations outside select/withColumn**:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

df.filter(col("names").contains("harsh"))
```

You can't just write:

```python
df.filter("names".contains("harsh"))  # ❌ Error
```

#### 2. **When using column objects in Python logic or functions**:

```python
df.select((col("salary") * 0.1).alias("bonus"))
```

This wouldn't work with a plain string:

```python
("salary" * 0.1).alias("bonus")  # ❌ TypeError
```

#### 3. **When dynamically referencing column names**:

Useful when column names are in a variable:

```python
col_name = "names"
df.select(split(col(col_name), "/")[0].alias("name1"))
```

#### 4. **For better readability in complex expressions**:

Some people use `col()` for clarity, especially in more complex chains of transformations.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

| Scenario                          | Use `col()`? |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Simple select/withColumn/filter   | Not needed   |
| Expressions with Python operators | ✅ Yes        |
| Dynamic column names              | ✅ Yes        |
| When PySpark can't infer context  | ✅ Yes        |
